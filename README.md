🎬 Movie Recommendation System 🍿
“Ever had Netflix ask, ‘Are you still watching?’ Well, now you’ll never want to stop!”

🧐 Overview
This project is a movie recommendation system built using machine learning techniques to suggest movies similar to your favorites. It uses cosine similarity to find movies based on features like genre, cast, and keywords.

⚙️ How It Works:
Input: You provide the name of a movie you like 🎥.
Output: A list of recommended movies 🍿 based on similarities in features like genre, keywords, cast, tagline, and director.
⭐ Key Features:
TF-IDF Vectorizer: 🎯 Converts text features (like genres, keywords, tagline, etc.) into numerical vectors using the TfidfVectorizer.
Cosine Similarity: 📊 Measures similarity between movie vectors and recommends movies closest to your favorite.
Difflib: 🤖 Handles fuzzy matching, ensuring recommendations work even if you don’t input the exact movie title.
🛠️ Technical Stuff:
Libraries Used:
🧮 numpy: For numerical operations.
🧑‍💻 pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
🔍 difflib: To find close matches for movie names.
📚 sklearn: Specifically for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
Key Methods:
TF-IDF Vectorization: 📝 Converts text data into numerical form for similarity calculations.
Cosine Similarity: 📈 Measures similarity between movie feature vectors to rank and recommend movies.
Data Handling:
🧹 Replacing null values in the dataset to avoid errors during vectorization.
🔗 Combining multiple features (genre, cast, keywords, etc.) into a single string for each movie to create richer vectors for comparison.
Performance:
🚀 The system ranks movies based on similarity and suggests the top similar movies for you to enjoy 🎉.
